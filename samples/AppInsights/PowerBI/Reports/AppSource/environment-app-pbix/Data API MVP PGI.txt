It would be great to simplify building and using the matrix pages - for now it is nightmare to build it and use it

a simple financial report, itsn't that contradictory?

not so much nightmare but painful enough ;-)  (reserving night mares for licensing questions ) 

[17.12] Krzysztof Bialowas
And next thing would be great to improve showing queries in Business Central. Now it works but you cannot do anything with the data

very important to have all 'regular' reporting in BC without having to purchase licenses for a ton of other products

For my GP friends, is this essentially what a smart list is?

This is nice view but more BC look is needed 

[17.15] Drew Poggemann (Guest)
Make sure when they apply grouping that it doesn't lose "ordering" within the groups.  This happens in D365 CE...

[17.15] Arend-Jan Kauffmann
A get a feeling I'm looking at Excel, displaying a data table. Aren't you just rebuilding it in BC?

[17.16] Krzysztof Bialowas
the biggest missing feature on the lists is -> they are from one table only

[17.16] BabiÄ‡ Vjeko
which is cool, really, I like it

[17.16] Eric Wauters
Looks good - would be even better when we could apply ths on a query-object..

only 1 question: performance impact 

[17.17] Daniel Rimmelzwaan
a query builder on top of a query 

[17.17] Stefano Demiliani
so this is something only for saas

[17.17] Krzysztof Bialowas
will you be able to save this view as normal view?

[17.18] Arend-Jan Kauffmann

would be even more cool if we can get the grid as a control add-in, right?

If we can apply this to queries - isn't that enough?

But you can. It's an open-source control, just use it any way you want.

one concern: it should be able to handle conflicts, e.g. when fields are being obsoleted.

I missed the first part.  Is this being recorded, and can I get the link?

[17.25] Eric Wauters
It's recording as we speak

if we want sometime get rid of IDs, why to introduce them into new features?

[17.30] Luc van Vugt
Wouldn't it need versioning?

[17.30] Belinda Allen
I can live with building the link out with fields, and filters, so long as I can get all the data. 

But...  Is there a source for non AL people to get documentation of fields and tables, beyond "CTRL-ALT-F1?

Kennie Pontoppidan can you repeat / confirm if data from 50000-99999 tables will be exposed? I heard the part about OP and ISV tables not being exposed

[17.31] Krzysztof Bialowas
It would be good to by default not show the table in Data API

[17.56] Jens MÃ¸ller-Pedersen
What about report datasets - is it worth it to expose them in a later iteration?

First thought: yes, as it probably opens up a lot of possibilities.

[17.59] Stefano Demiliani
very cool... thanks a lot
