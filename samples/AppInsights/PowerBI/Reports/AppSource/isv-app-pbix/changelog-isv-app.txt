Ideas
* Errors: On all pages, add visuals to show count last day, last week, older
* Performance: On page 'Pageviews', added per-app/per-object visuals
* Dataset: on all queries, link to AppDim. Add global filters
* Dataset: collapse app name and id in appDim hierarchy
* Usage: use combined app name and id on X by app visuals (clients, locations, pageviews, reports, ...)
* Performance: use combined app name and id on X by app visuals (pageviews, reports, incoming ws, outgoing ws, Updates)
* Administration: App inventory query needs a rework 
* Administration: Data in telemetry page, stats by app visual has data where app is empty, probably needs fixing in the dataset


The little things
* Usage: integrations page - consider showing by host and then by endpoint (check parity with VAR app)
* Usage: 'Feature uptake' page, add domain to Environment information visual
* Errors: extension lifecycle page, make error details visual full width
* Errors: on incoming/outgoing ws errors pages, get parity with corresponding perf pages and align with VAR app

vNext (implemented, coming in the next release, probably available in the beta app)

* Administration report: Added hierarchy, message details, and feature telemetry dimension for events on telemetry event statistics page
* Performance report: Added 'number of columns' and 'Take locks' fields to SQL statements visual on Long Running SQL page
* Performance report: Added ability to do version-to-version comparisons on 'Updates' page
* All four reports: turned on ability to download underlaying data from all visuals
* All four reports: turned on to analyze further with KQL on all pages
* Dataset: tuned all KQL queries. Impact is up to 5x faster refresh time.

Ideas 
-----
-	Is it possible to add list of objects in a format like the AAD tenant mapping? So we can see objects especially pages and reports never used?
Need to know the scenario better here

-	In the extension lifecycle please filter out the “already synced” ;)
This is being fixed now by the compiler team.

-	In some pages you print stack traces or error message. This is fine, but can we add the operationId, so the developers can use it in KQL for further analysis.
Good idea, also valuable for the VAR app

-	In the Performance report a percentile (95th) would be useful (like in Azure Portal Application Insights).
Good idea, also valuable for the VAR app

-	Is it possible to visualize performance degradation over days or weeks?

-	Is it possible to group error message, like permission related error messages?

-	For performance and error analysis it would be nice the see if the process was initiated by the Job Queue. This could be done by object ids 450 or 451 in the call stack. Filtering on the background client type is not sufficient.
Good idea, also valuable for the VAR app

DONE: For webservice calls (especially the outgoing ones) add a filter for OnPrem, because this is nothing we can influence as an ISV.
