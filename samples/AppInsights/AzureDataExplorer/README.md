In this folder, you will find samples that illustrate how you can query Azure Application Insights data using **Azure Data Explorer** with **KQL Queries**.

**Which Azure Data Explorer queries are available?**  This repository contains an Azure Data Explorer sample dashboard for Business Central.  The dashboard is made up of the following pages.  Each page contains tiles that are powered by KQL queries.
* Overview
* SQL Query Usage
* AL Method Usage
* SOAP Usage
* OData Usage
* API Usage
* Job Queue
* Upgrades
* Database Locks
* Lookup

**How do I use Azure Data Explorer queries to query telemetry?**  
To use the dashboard, do as follows
1.	Ensure you have your AppInsights Resources setup.
2.	Download the sample Azure Data Explorer dashboard.
3.	Go to https://DataExplorer.azure.com/dashboards 
4.	In the upper left corner, click on the dropdown next to “New Dashboard” and select “Import dashboard from file”.
5.	Select the downloaded Azure Data Explorer dashboard sample to import.
6.	After the dashboard has been imported, click on the “Edit” icon in the upper left corner of the dashboard.
7.	Next, click on the “Data Sources” icon and then click on the edit icon on the BCAppInsights Data Source.
8.	Edit the Cluster URI to match your AppInsights information:  
https://ade.applicationinsights.io/subscriptions/ **Subscription ID** /resourcegroups/ **Resource Group**
* **Subscription ID** - can be found at [Subscriptions - Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade)
* **Resource Group** - can be found at [Application Insights - Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/microsoft.insights%2Fcomponents)

9.	Lastly, click on the “Connect” button.  The Database name should be that same as your AppInsights Resource.  Leave the Data Source Name” as BCAppInsights.  This will be used by all the queries and if it is changed, then all the queries will need to be updated.
Limitations: The current version of the queries fails if the KQL queries do not return any rows. This could be due to data not being available within a selected time frame.  Try extending the query time frame to increase the chances of finding data to report on.  Another issue might be related to when the AppInsights key was updated on the tenants.  It does take a little time to have the data collected for your AppInsights key.
