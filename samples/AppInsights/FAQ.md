# Business Central Telemetry FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

## How do I get started?
Business Central can send telemetry to one or more **Azure Application Insights** (Application Insights) accounts.
The first step thus is for you to create an Application Insights account.
See [HERE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-telemetry) for instructions on how to do that.

Once you have created the Application Insights account, make a note of the *connection string*.

The next step depends on whether you are an ISV or a VAR:
* If you are an **ISV**, you must specify the connection string in your app.json file. Once the app is installed in a Business Central environment, telemetry relating to your app will start to flow into your Application Insights account.

* If you are a **VAR**, you must enter the connection string in the Business Central Admin Center of your customer(s). Once you have done that, telemetry relating to your customers will start to flow into your Application Insights account. You can also set the connection string using the Business Central Administration Center API.

## What does it cost?
See our documentation here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview#ingest

Azure monitor alerts are billed separately.

Here is a quote from a partner using telemetry:
_We have been using telemetry for some months now and have enabled 20+ apps as well as environment data from dev systems and build pipelines. Last month we ingested 800+ traces that corresponded to 2.3GB of data. Eventually we might hit some of those thresholds, but then we can decide if we want to spend money on telemetry (probably will) and how much. With our current setup, we will probably limit ingestion and once that no longer suffices, we will add sampling to the mix._

## How can I control cost?
See our documentation here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-control-cost

In August 2022, the Azure Monitor made a new feature available called *Data Collection Rules*. This allows you to define rules on what is ingested into your telemetry resource. 
 
These two blog posts by Business Central community telemetry experts Bert Verbeek and Stefano Demiliani
* https://www.bertverbeek.nl/blog/2022/08/10/save-cost-on-your-telemetry/
* https://demiliani.com/2022/08/09/dynamics-365-business-central-filtering-telemetry-signals-with-azure-monitor-data-collection-rules/

go into a lot of details on how this works. When the feature is made generally available, we will add similar guidance to the official Business Central documentation.

You can use this KQL query [MonthlyIngestion.kql](KQL/Queries/HelperQueries/MonthlyIngestion.kql) to see the data distribution of different event ids in your telemetry database.

See all helper queries here: [HelperQueries](KQL/Queries/HelperQueries/)

## Should each customer/app have their own Application Insights resource, rather than one insight for multiple customers?
Partitioning of Application Insights resources across multiple customers or apps depends on what you use telemetry for. The benefit of having a 1-1 relationship between customers/apps and Application Insights resources is that you can also use the Usage features in the Application Insights portal to monitor how a particular customer is using BC and you can setup and share the Power BI app with the customer directly without having to fear that one customer can see data from another customer. It also makes it easy to separate the cost of telemetry per customer/app. Downside of a 1-1 relationship between customers/apps and Application Insights resources is that you have more Azure resources to manage, including any cross-customer alerting/monitoring that you might want to setup.

Also, it is recommended to separate per-environment telemetry from per-app telemetry into separate Application Insights resources.

## I want to learn about telemetry. Where are the blogs?
Please visit the [Video page](VIDEOS.md) for learning resources published as videos if you love to learn things this way.

Please visit the [Blogs page](BLOGS.md) for learning resources published as blogs if blogs is your thing.


## Where can I learn more about Kusto Query Language (KQL) and Azure Data Studio?
Please visit the [KQL README page](KQL/README.md) for learning resources on KQL and the [Trouble Shooting Guides README page](TroubleShootingGuides/README.md) for learning resources on Azure Data Studio.

## How can I see what data is available in my Application Insights subscription
Use this KQL query [AvailableSignal.kql](KQL/Queries/HelperQueries/AvailableSignal.kql) to see if you have any data in your telemetry database, and also what kind of signal is present.

See all helper queries here: [HelperQueries](KQL/Queries/HelperQueries/)

## What is the data retention policy in Application Insights?
The default retention for Application Insights resources is 90 days. Different retention periods can be selected for each Application Insights resource. The full set of available retention periods is 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 270, 365, 550 or 730 days.

See <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/pricing#change-the-data-retention-period> 

## How do I delete data from Application Insights?
Purge data in an Application Insights component by a set of user-defined filters.

See <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/application-insights/components/purge#examples> 

You can use Powershell to setup a purge process, see an example here: [How do I use Powershell to delete telemetry data?](Powershell/README.md)

## Can I grant read-only access to Application Insights?
To grant a person read-only access to Application Insights, go to the Access control (IAM) page in the Application Insights portal, and then add the role assignment "Reader" to the person. 

You might also need to add the role assignment "Reader" to the person on the Resource Group for the Application Insights subscription.

## What about Privacy regulations such as GDPR?
The Business Central service does not emit any End User Identifiable Information (EUII) to Application Insights. So the telemetry is born GDPR compliant. The service only emits data that is classified as either System Metadata or Organization Identifiable Information (OII). The meaning of these classifications are described here: [DataClassification Option Type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/dataclassification/dataclassification-option)

## Can I get telemetry in Azure Application Insights for on-premises installations?
Yes, telemetry also work for on-premises installations (private or public cloud). A few events are not emitted when running Business Central on-premises (see an overview here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview). See here how to enable telemetry on-premises: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-enable-application-insights#enable-on-tenants

## Will you backport the Application Insights instrumentation to versions prior to 15.0?
It took a lot of refactoring in the server and client to make this happen. So it is unlikely that we will backport the Application Insights instrumentation to versions prior to 15.0.

For each new signal type we add, we try to backport to the current major release (16.x right now) if possible.

For on-premises installations (private or public cloud), you can create an application/service that listens on the ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) events that we use for internal telemetry and then send them to Application Insights. Note that this approach is depending on internal telemetry events that might change and that are not documented by Microsoft.

This is documented here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tools-monitor-performance-counters-and-events and here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/monitor-server-events

See the Application Insights documentation for an introduction on how to emit telemetry from a .NET console application:
[The Application Insights for .NET console applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/console)


Another option is to emit ETW events to Azure Log Analytics, see Marije Brummels blog post [Using Azure Log Analytics on older Dynamics NAV versions (blog post)](https://marijebrummel.blog/2021/11/28/using-azure-log-analytics-on-older-dynamics-nav-versions/) or her Github sample repo [Using Azure Log Analytics with Dynamics NAV (Github repo)](https://github.com/marijebrummel/Azure.LogAnalytics.NAV) for examples.

## I deployed Azure dashboards, but they show no data
If you have data present in Application Insights, please check the setting in the *Time range* selector on the  dashboard:

# Q&A from Office Hours 2022-10-04
## Could I have alerts by email or teams when I receive an error?

A: This is not built into the App - however, the telemetry is added to Application Insights - and there you can set up 
flows that send email on e.g. a signal of a given type.


## How can we make a demo of the telemetry? Is that only available in an BC365 saas? Or can we install and test the telemetry  inside a docker container?

A: You can set the Application Insights Connection String for an on-premise server (a server setting). See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-enable-application-insights#for-on-premises-environments-single-tenant-mode


## These options for ISV are only for AppSource or it is possible to use them as PTE extension?

A: The ISV app works for both appsource apps and PTEs.


## Can you filter on environment type, that is SaaS vs OnPrem?"

A: Yes. On-prem will have common/default as aad tenant id(Can you filter on environment type, that is SaaS vs OnPrem?


## Is there a best practice how to exclude the events coming from the own development of the ISV solution to distinguish it from events coming from the real users/customers?

A: Yes, this is documented here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview#ingest
or here https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/blob/master/samples/AppInsights/FAQ.md#how-can-i-control-cost


## What kind of powerbi license is needed to use these apps?

A: Power bi pro (costs 10 USD per month per user)


## Could you please send the link to download the power bi for ISV?

A: This is the install link for the ISV app: aka.ms/bctelemetry-isv-app
This is the install link for the VAR app: aka.ms/bctelemetryreport


## We use Telemetry for all many customers. Request: can we have Tenant ID (or better still Name from the mapping) and Environment Name appearing on every table please so we can filter on multiple customers/environments at once

A: Yes. This is already done in many of the pages (except in the performance report). More will be transformed to show this.


## We have many Product Apps with different Application Insights. Can we use just one dashboard?

A: No. The Power BI app cannot read data from multiple Application Insights resources.


## How often is the data updated in the Power BI Dashboards?  

A: Default is daily. You can change this in the dataset settings. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-power-bi-app#configure-an-app-after-initial-setup


## If a customer contacts support because they have had an error, how quickly will it be to view/validate on the dashboard?"

A: Default refresh of data in the dashboard is daily. You can change this in the dataset settings. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-power-bi-app#configure-an-app-after-initial-setup


## The ability to export the ""underlying data"" is disabled? Will we be able to do this in the future?

A: This was fixed in the December 2022 update.


## Does activating telemetry affect the performance of Business Central?

A: Nothing that users will notice.


## Is there some kind of estimater to give an indication on much it cost to collect and store all this data?

A: At aka.ms/bctelemetry there are descriptions of how you can control costs. So far we have not had partners reporting significant costs - the lowest SKU will normally be sufficient


## Can you remind where to go to set the Tenant mapping? I had the app installed for already?

A: See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-power-bi-app#configure-an-app-after-initial-setup
