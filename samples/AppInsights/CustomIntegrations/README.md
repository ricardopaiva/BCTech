# How do I create a link (URL) that opens a KQL query in the Azure Application Insights portal?
It is possible to programatically create links that will run and show results of a KQL query in Azure Application Insights portal.

To do this, first you need to encode the KQL query text: Take the raw query text, zip it, Base64 encode it, and then url encode it.

Next, go to the Azure Application Insights portal where data resides and note the following GUIDs and names:
- AAD tenant id
- Azure subscription id
- Azure resource group name
- Azure Application Insights instance name

Now, you can construct the URL:
```
https://portal.azure.com/#@<AAD tenant id>/blade/Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring_Logs/LogsBlade/resourceId/%2Fsubscriptions%2F<Azure subscription id>%2FresourceGroups%2F<Azure resource group name>%2Fproviders%2Fmicrosoft.insights%2Fcomponents%2F<Azure Application Insights instance name>/source/LogsBlade.AnalyticsShareLinkToQuery/q/<Encoded KQL query>
```
(substitute the strings "<id>" with the actual values)

# How do I read telemetry data from Azure Application Insights with C#?
The Azure SDK for .NET has an API for interacting with Azure Application Insights, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.applicationinsights?view=azure-dotnet

Specifically, after having authenticated to Azure Application Insights, the method ApplicationInsightsDataClientExtensions.Query can be used to execute KQL queries from C#, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.applicationinsights.applicationinsightsdataclientextensions.query?view=azure-dotnet

Use these NuGet packages in your project:
- Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime.Azure.Authentication (for authenticating your app to read data from Azure Application Insights)
- Microsoft.Azure.ApplicationInsights (for reading data using the Azure Application Insights REST API)
