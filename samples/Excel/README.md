## Customer Sales List layout
The Customer Sales List layout showcase a number of techniques that you might want to explore for your own layouts
1. The two worksheets _Sales by Customer_ and _Customer Sales by Location_ show how you can use combine a pivot table with slicers and charts to create simple, yet effective interactive reports. Note that you can edit header texts in the pivot table. The _Customer Sales by Location_ sheet show an important learning: add fixed size visuals (the slicers and charts) above dynamic size visuals (the pivot table) so that the report stil work with different data distributions. 
2. The worksheet _Customer Mailing List_ showcase how you can use table formulas in Excel to create calculated columns. See the [FAQ page](FAQ.md) for more information on table formulas in Excel.
3. The worksheet _Customers and credit_ showcase the use of Power Query in a layout. Navigate to Data, Get Data, Launch Power Query Editor. Now click on the _Credit score_ query and click _Advanced Editor_. What you see here is a M query (which is the programming language used in Power Query). Don't let this scare you, you rarely need to edit the raw M code. Note that on the first line, you can see where data is located (in the example, it is an Excel workbook stored on a Sharepoint site). You can use Power Query to read almost any kind of data you can imagine and merge/join this to the report dataset generated by Business Central. See the [FAQ page](FAQ.md) for more information on how to use Power Query in Excel.
